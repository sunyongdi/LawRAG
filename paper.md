# RAG (Retrieved-Augmented Generation) for LLM:A Curated Collection

This Markdown is dedicated to curating high-quality papers, resources, and tools related to RAG in the context of Large Language Models (LLM). RAG bridges the gap between retrieval-based and generation-based methods, offering a promising approach for knowledge-intensive tasks.
